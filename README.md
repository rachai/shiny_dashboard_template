# Shiny Dashboard Template

A template dashboard with a module-like design that serves as a skeleton to get
you up and running quickly.

The dashboard contains multiple sidebar menu items, each of which sources it's 
content from one or more standalone scripts. 

Credits to @6chaoran. This structure is based on one of his blog posts 
(https://6chaoran.wordpress.com/2019/06/12/build-a-unified-shiny-portal-with-login-page/).

I find this structure intuitive, but please note that it is modular-like and is **not** 
the same as described in the Rstudio documentation on modularizing apps (https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html).

Hope this is useful for someone else.
